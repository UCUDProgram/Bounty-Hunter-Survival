# Bounty-Hunter-Survival

You are an intergalactic time travelling bounty hunter named Mole.  You were pursuing the most wanted man in time.  The criminal out smarted you and damaged your ship.  You were forced to crash land on Earth, in a different reality.  In this different reality, the Earth is run by zombies.  These zombies are comming to kill you.  Fortunately, you have your trusty gun with you and can kill zombies attacking you.  You must stay alive and hope your bosses will rescue you before you die.

The zombies move in random movements, so thinking you have them is not always guaranteed.
